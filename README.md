# Swoofybot
Simple discord bot WIP

This bot was initially created as i learn to code in js and to test myself with managing a project on github during lockdown, i will be updating this bot over time as i learn.

Swoofybot now hosted! First time setting up a bot on VPN

Will be formatting this correctly soon and creating a wiki page as the bot grows
